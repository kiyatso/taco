			<p> I am a junior at hofstra university and my major is information technology.
			since I transferred here and wasn't sure what i wanted to focus my studies on, and I am
			a bit behind on the classes/credits that i need for my IT/Business Major, I will be 
			most likely staying at hofstra till fall of 2020. Aside from having a career path i'm trying to follow,
			I have hobbies that I believe define me in positive ways. for example, this webpage is called Jimjam's taco House...
			I love Mexican food, mainly burritos. when I was a child, I didn't understand the beauty that was mexican food, but now 
			it's become a funny joke within my life. it's gotten to the point where friends that i dont know in real life know my love for 
			Mexican food and often associate me with taco bell, it's truly a blessing. if I was able to eat burritos every single day, I would.
			</p>
			<p> Some of my hobbies are...</p>
			<ul>
				<li>play Guitar</li>
				<li>play video games</li>
				<li>eat burritos</li>
				<li>sing</li>
				
			</ul>
